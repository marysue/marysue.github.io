							<p>"Mary is an amazing person and an incredible resource. No-one 
							digs into a problem like Mary, and her attention to detail is 
							second-to-none. At Toolwire Mary inherited a system in desperate 
							need of a "new sheriff". Where there was chaos and disparity Mary 
							brought order and conformity."</p>

							<p>"It’s my great pleasure to recommend Mary. I’ve worked directly 
							with her for 5 years now. She is one of my primary go-to people at 
							Toolwire and the true one-stop resource for everything about our 
							OnDemand hosting platform. I can always rely on Mary to put her 
							heart and soul into everything she does. She consistently 
							demonstrates leadership initiative, leaving a path of organization 
							and documentation where there previously was only chaos. She does 
							a wonderful job of cross training the software and technical 
							operations teams after every major project she manages or builds. 
							Dogged, driven, fun, engaged, curious and thoughtful, are just 
							some of the wonderful adjectives that describe her. If I go to 
							another company I am bringing Mary with me if I can. So don't hire 
							her JUST yet... "</p>

							<p>"Mary is a delight to work with and easy to get along. She has a 
							lot of energy, and has a ready smile and works well with everyone. 
							She had to come up to speed on lots of advanced technical details 
							of projects and she was able to do so with ease. She is detail 
							oriented and is able to deliver her tasks on time. Highly 
							recommended."</p>
