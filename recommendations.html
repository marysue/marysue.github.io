                        <p>"I worked with Mary on a client project with vague guidelines and large customer knowledge gaps.
                            With Mary’s hard work, and the team’s dedication, we were able to help the customer discover the
                            technical requirements for a non-technical statement of work, to parse that work into concrete
                            requirements, and to execute on those requirements while coordinating with third party vendors.
                            Mary took technical direction well where needed, worked doggedly to fill in knowledge gaps,
                            and executed on tasks exactly as expected.  Mary conducts all communication with customers
                            and co-workers to utmost professional standards, and her professional maturity is an asset in
                            an office setting for mentoring new employees." </p>

                        Her attention to detail is one of her strongest assets. Her persistence to ensure the correct information
                        is collected and returned to clients points to her project management /business analyst skills.
                        Mary’s eagerness helps a team achieve consensus on expectations of assigned tasks. Mary is not afraid to
                        ask questions until she has a complete grasp of her responsibilities. I appreciate her contributions and

                        with her for 5 years now. She is one of my primary go-to people at
                        Toolwire and the true one-stop resource for everything about our
                        OnDemand hosting platform. I can always rely on Mary to put her
                        heart and soul into everything she does. She consistently
                        demonstrates leadership initiative, leaving a path of organization
                        and documentation where there previously was only chaos. She does
                        a wonderful job of cross training the software and technical
                        operations teams after every major project she manages or builds.
                        Dogged, driven, fun, engaged, curious and thoughtful, are just
                        some of the wonderful adjectives that describe her. If I go to
