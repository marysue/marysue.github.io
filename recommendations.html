							<p>"Mary is a phenomenal teammate and has been as much a friend as a co-worker. She is a diligent worker who loves deeply understanding issues and putting her mind to generating creative solutions. She has a passion for learning new skills and technologies and building on her already strong software knowledge-base. She is a great team player that any team would be lucky to have. "</p>

							<p>"Mary is a driven, detail-oriented professional with a strong eagerness to learn. She's a joy to work with—sweet, social, and caring, always creating a positive and supportive atmosphere for those around her.

							<p>"It’s my great pleasure to recommend Mary. I’ve worked directly
							with her for 5 years now. She is one of my primary go-to people at
							Toolwire and the true one-stop resource for everything about our
							OnDemand hosting platform. I can always rely on Mary to put her
							heart and soul into everything she does. She consistently
							demonstrates leadership initiative, leaving a path of organization
							and documentation where there previously was only chaos. She does
							a wonderful job of cross training the software and technical
							operations teams after every major project she manages or builds.
							Dogged, driven, fun, engaged, curious and thoughtful, are just
							some of the wonderful adjectives that describe her. If I go to
							another company I am bringing Mary with me if I can. So don't hire
							her JUST yet... "</p>

							lot of energy, and has a ready smile and works well with everyone.
							She had to come up to speed on lots of advanced technical details
							of projects and she was able to do so with ease. She is detail
							oriented and is able to deliver her tasks on time. Highly
							recommended."</p>
