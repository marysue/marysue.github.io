					<center><h2>Watcher: An event-driven powershell script</h2></center>
					<h3>Background:</h3>
					<p>Watcher.ps1 is intended to run on a virtual machine.  In the paradigm we were 
					working with, virtual machines are created by copying from a pristine archive 
					copy of a virtual machine. An archive is a virtual machine, operating system and
					software installed, group policy, registry and user settings set properly.  The
					virtual machine is then shut-down.  From this point forward, the virtual machine is
					referred to as an archive, and is typically never started again. They are simply 
					copied and the copy is used.  This way we can guarantee the integrity of the VM 
					assigned to the user.</p>

					<p>Once the archive has been created and shut down, the new vm is then copied and
					started.  When the VM is running the user&#8217;s files are mounted via a network 
					mount and the machine is ready for the user to log on. </p>

					<p>Upon logoff, the user files are dismounted, and the virtual machine is then 
					destroyed.</p>

					<h3>About the powershell script:</h3>
					<p>In some cases we can point software to look to the network mount for its files, 
					rather than the C:\ drive, however in some cases the software cannot be redirected.
					Such is the case with Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver expects the website files to 
					reside in c:\inetpub\wwwroot.  But because the c:\ drive is destroyed when the 
					user logs out, we had to devise a mechanism such that the files from the 
					user&#8217;s persistent storage were automatically copied to the 
					c:\inetpub\wwwroot directory at login &#8212; and when the files were updated, 
					these updates would be mirrored in the user&#8217;s persistent storage.</p>

					<p>In this script, the watcher object is a file system object provided by 
					powershell.  The watcher object has event-driven methods that automatically 
					respond to events that can occur on a file system object.  The watcher object 
					has the ability to determine which files are changed, deleted, or added.</p>

					<p>Initially we define toPath as the path to the persistent 
					storage.  We copy all files from toPath down to c:\inetpub\wwwroot as the user 
					logs on.  Once copied, we begin watching the file system and based upon the event 
					that occurs (creation, deletion, or change) watcher will execute accordingly.</p>

					<p>At anytime the user logs off we know that the files on the persistent storage 
					mirror exactly the files in wwwroot directory.  When the virtual machine shuts 
					down,the persistent storage (network mounted drive) is then detached and 
					preserved, and finally the virtual machine is destroyed.</p>

					<p>When the student logs back in, a new clean virtual machine is cloned from the 
					pristine archive copy,  the persistent storage is mounted on the virtual machine 
					via a network mount, and the files are then copied down into wwwroot for use by 
					Dreamweaver.  Rinse and repeat.</p>
