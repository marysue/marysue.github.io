Page layout is a very visual and subjective topic.  The more artistic your eye, I believe, the better your page layouts will be.

The key points I took away from designing the Exceptional Realty Website from spec were the following:

1.  Running a full page of text, straight across, is not always best.  Try to break it up into two or three columns for ease of reading.
2.  Use div's to surround areas that will change depending upon the browser width.  This makes writing the responsive CSS easier.
3.  Fonts:   Sans Serif fonts such as Arial and Verdana are easier to read online.  The ideal font size for reading easily online is 16px
4.  Remember to always make your layout mobile friendly.  Websites that are not responsive are basically useless in this day.
5.  Use gradients in colors and page shadows.  It eases the visual effect from stark to soft and welcoming.
