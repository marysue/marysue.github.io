After working in software engineering for 8 years+, I found myself working at my last job doing a *little* of everything. 

When I described what I was doing:  JavaScript, JSP pages, XML, Oracle PL/SQL programming, writing JavaBeans, extending Java code,  working with Json, XML, HTML, and CSS - I was informed that what I was doing was full-stack engineering.  And I loved it!  

So why am I studying at Flatiron on their Community Powered Edition?  Because employers have consistently stated that I'm not well-rounded enough.  How can that be?  Well,  I have only extended code in each of those areas.  I haven't designed and implemented a full stack from A to Z.  And frankly, they're right.  If you asked me right now to create a website's front and back-end I wouldn't know where to start.

This course is introducing me to technology and languages I haven't used:  Ruby and Rails, TDD development,  React, Redux,  and Sinatra.  All languages in demand.  

HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript - I've done these before.  But clearly these won't drive a job offer into my lap.

By the end, I hope to have a nice portfolio demonstrating that not only am I a full-stack engineer, but I know how to knit together a nicely built web site from A-Z.

Data structures and algorithms?  I hate to say this, but after entering software engineering, lo those many years ago, there hasn't be a huge demand for complex data structures or mind-bening algorithms.  Clearly I need a brush up in these areas as well.

So I'm diving in with both feet.  I'm learning my nth language with a positive vision for my future!  I'm excited to shed the "generalist" software engineer title and dive into the newly polished full-stack engineer role.

I cannot wait!  

Now back to studying Ruby.
