<p><b>Overview of Experience:</b>  Having started working as a Unix systems administrator for an Stanford artifical
  intelligence start-up, I moved into software engineering with my first coding job as an associate engineer.  Later, I continued on to
  software engineering for an enterprise development company working in a business consulting environment for a large Dutch bank using c
  while developing an optical character recognition system. Later I worked for a medical device company developing a control system for
  both aperture and power control on a therapeutic radiation system working in C++ and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Most recently I spent the past 6-7 years working as a software engineering generalist for an E-Learning company.  At this company we
  provided virtualized desktops through the browser for clients like Capella, Kaplan, and University of Phoenix for their online students.
  Our latest product was a game platform for learning, incorporating gaming aspects with virtualized desktops. At this company I performed
  some systems administration duties creating Citrix virtualized environments from LANS, attaching persistent storage, and creating
  virtual machines configured to spec.  This required a significant amount of small-tool coding using scripting languages as well as
  C#.Net and VB.Net.</p>

<p>Finally, for the last 2 years I worked on an Agile Development team offloading our senior architect and senior engineer while expanding
  and maintaining our database, creating web pages to spec, creating testing harnesses and expanding our middleware application stack.
</p>

<p>At this time I served as both SME for the company's complex workflow, as well as mentor for the more junior engineers.  In advancing
the servicability of our system, I created a corporate Wiki for steps in deploying new systems and troubleshooting current systems as
well as delivering a series of courses on understanding, deploying new and maintaining the current inventory of virtualized environments.</p>

<p>After surviving 5 reduction in workforce layoffs, I finally documented and trained my way out of a job!  </p>

<p>For a brief period after that I joined a consulting company in Eagle, Idaho.  I quickly learned that due to my experience my assignments
  were in the areas of Business Analysis and Quality Assurance.  Quickly realizing that was the direction the company had intended for me
  I decided to return to school and freshen up my technical stack.</p>

<p>Currently I am attending the 24-week appAcademy full stack engineering course.  I'm adding to my toolkit: JavaScript, Node.js, React, and freshening up
  my data structures, algorithms, recursive algorithms, SQL, HTML5 and CSS.</p>

<p>In January, 2021, I will be available for full-time work in a mid-level developer capacity.  My target employment area will be either Remote, or in the
  San Francisco Bay Area.  With my broad background and newly updated tech stack,I have no doubt that I will qickly advance my skillset and become a valuable
  asset to my next development effort.</p>
