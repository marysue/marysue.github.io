<p><b>Overview of Experience:</b>  Having started working as a Unix systems administrator for an Stanford artifical 
  intelligence start-up, I moved into software engineering with my first coding job as an associate engineer.  Later, I continued on to 
  software engineering for an enterprise development company working in a business consulting environment for a large Dutch bank using c 
  while developing an optical character recognition system. Later I worked for a medical device company developing a control system for 
  both aperture and power control on a therapeutic radiation system working in C++ and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Most recently I spent the past 6-7 years working as a software engineering generalist for an E-Learning company.  At this company we 
  provided virtualized desktops through the browser for clients like Capella, Kaplan, and University of Phoenix for their online students.
  Our latest product was a game platform for learning, incorporating gaming aspects with virtualized desktops. At this company I performed 
  some systems administration duties creating Citrix virtualized environments from LANS, attaching persistent storage, and creating
  virtual machines configured to spec.  This required a significant amount of small-tool coding using scripting languages as well as 
  C#.Net and VB.Net.</p>

<p>Finally, for the last 2 years I worked on an Agile Development team offloading our senior architect and senior engineer while expanding 
  and maintaining our database, creating web pages to spec, creating testing harnesses and expanding our middleware application stack.  
</p>

<p>At this time I served as both SME for the company's complex workflow, as well as mentor for the more junior engineers.  In advancing
the servicability of our system, I created a corporate Wiki for steps in deploying new systems and troubleshooting current systems as 
well as delivering a series of courses on understanding, deploying new and maintaining the current inventory of virtualized environments.</p>

<p>After surviving 5 reduction in workforce layoffs, I finally documented and trained my way out of a job!  Recently I have returned to 
  online school, having just finished an HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, and JavaScript course.  Next up?  React and Node.js.
  I'm having an immense amount of fun learning these languages and will be posting my accomplishments on my blog on this site. </p>

<p>Currently I am available for full-time work in a junior developer capacity.  With my broad experience with many scripting languages
  and several c-based languages, I have no doubt that I will qickly advance my skillset and become a valuable asset to my next development 
  effort.</p>
