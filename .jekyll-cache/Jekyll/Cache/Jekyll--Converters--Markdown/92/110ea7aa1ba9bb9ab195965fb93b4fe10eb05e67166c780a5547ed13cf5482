I"H<p>I love well defined booleans.  I love functions that return booleans that are well named.  It makes reading code so much easier:</p>

<p>if (hasMyName?(thisString)) {
    printf(“It has my name”);
} else {
    printf(“Sorry - my name isn’t there”);
}</p>

<p>When using booleans, make certain the variable names or function names are clear and unambiguous.  isBlueSky, rather than just blueSky.</p>

<p>My singular requirement when writing functions is to keep them simple.  Don’t try to do too much.  Returning a boolean from a function is clear and unambiguous.</p>
