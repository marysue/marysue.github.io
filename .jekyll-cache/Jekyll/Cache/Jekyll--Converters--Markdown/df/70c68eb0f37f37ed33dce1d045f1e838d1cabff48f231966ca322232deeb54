I"E<p>After working in software engineering for 8 years+, I found myself working at my last job doing a <em>little</em> of everything.</p>

<p>When I described what I was doing:  JavaScript, JSP pages, XML, Oracle PL/SQL programming, writing JavaBeans, extending Java code,  working with Json, XML, HTML, and CSS - I was informed that what I was doing was full-stack engineering.  And I loved it!</p>

<p>So why am I studying at Flatiron on their Community Powered Edition?  Because employers have consistently stated that I’m not well-rounded enough.  How can that be?  Well,  I have only extended code in each of those areas.  I haven’t designed and implemented a full stack from A to Z.  And frankly, they’re right.  If you asked me right now to create a website’s front and back-end I wouldn’t know where to start.</p>

<p>This course is introducing me to technology and languages I haven’t used:  Ruby and Rails, TDD development, React, Redux, and Sinatra.  All languages in demand.</p>

<p>HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript - I’ve done these before.  But clearly these won’t drive a job offer into my lap.</p>

<p>By the end, I hope to have a nice portfolio demonstrating that not only am I a full-stack engineer, but I know how to knit together a nicely built web site from A-Z.</p>

<p>Data structures and algorithms?  I hate to say this, but after entering software engineering, lo those many years ago, there hasn’t be a huge demand for complex data structures or mind-bending algorithms.  Clearly I need a brush up in these areas as well.</p>

<p>So I’m diving in with both feet.  I’m learning my nth language with a positive vision for my future!  I’m excited to shed the “generalist” software engineer title and dive into the newly polished full-stack engineer role.</p>

<p>I cannot wait!</p>

<p>Now back to studying Ruby.</p>
