# Responsive Features Code-Along

## Overview

In this code along exercise we will make our layout responsive using CSS media
queries. All the files you need to follow along are provided and opening this
code along on the in-browser IDE will fork and clone down a copy for you, but
if you would like to continue working from your personal `exceptional-realty`
repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username_here>/exceptional-realty
cd exceptional-realty
```

In this code along, we'll be working on a branch `responsive-design`.

As always, make sure to add, commit and push any work you've done on a personal
repository!
