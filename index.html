						<p class="profile">Having a broad background in software engineering, starting as a Unix Systems Administrator, moving
						into Software Development has allowed me to quickly assimilate into complex environments quickly.</p>

						<p class="profile">After graduating from San Francisco State University, I spent 4 years programming
						in c and C++ in the gnu-unix and Visual Studio environments in financial systems and medical
						device enterprise development organizations.</p>

						<p class="profile">Taking a 12 year sabatical to raise my family (because of course, raising a family is like a vacation - right?),
						I returned to my technical career:
						First, working customer support and technical assistance at an Internet Service Provider
						installing security certificates and websites in Microsoft IIS/Apache-Tomcat environments.Then working as an IT Engineer for an educational services provider, providing customized citrix virtual
						environments, installing gateways, routers, domains, and virtualized desktops in both the Linux and Microsoft
						O/S's.  Shell scripting with Perl, VisualBasic, PowerShell, etc. were my main tools.</p>

						<p class="profile">The final year I moved into full-time development on an Agile development team working
						with Object Oriented programming.  I developed software within a pre-designed framework,
						expanding and maintaining code in Java.  Although having such versatility on the job was interesting,
						focusing on full-stack engineering was where I thrived.  It was the perfect combination of using my
						past experience working with SQL, and c-based languages, but incorporated the front-end technologies
						HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JSP, JUnit, and XML.</p>

						<p class="profile">Not all good things last.  That company downsized dramatically and I needed to move on.  Finally, after spending a few years as an independent web designer, I decided to refresh my technical
							skills by returning to school.  I wanted a bootcamp that offered more than 3 mos instruction so I felt solid with my new skills
							before returning to work.  I found just that in appAcademy's 6-month immersive bootcamp.
						</p>

						<p class="profile">Having just graduated from appAcademy's bootcamp, I'm proud to announce my tech stack is well updated with: JavaScript,
							JSON, HTML, CSS, RegExp, Python, Pug Templates, React, Redux, Express.js, NodeJS, postgreSQL, MS SQL, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Docker.
						</p>
						<p class="profile">I am currently available for full time work in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Hit me up if you're looking for someone with
							a nice broad background, current tech skills, leadership and mentorship skills, AND brings fun, smiles, and a high level of productivity and commitment to the workplace!  I'll make you a star for placing me!

						</div>
						<div class="recommend first">
							<p>"Mary is a wonderful person to work with.  She isn't afraid to dive in deep on new and complex topics,
							and she is positive and encouraging to those around her. She does what needs to be done and can see
							the big picture to understand why it is necessary. She has a high degree of skill in front-end frameworks
							such as JavaScript and Angular, and is adept at organizing, structuring, and supporting Agile teams."</p>

							Manager, Software Development, Allata
						</div>
						<div class="recommend">
							<p>"I worked with Mary on a client project with vague guidelines and large customer knowledge gaps.
								With Mary’s hard work, and the team’s dedication, we were able to help the customer discover the
								technical requirements for a non-technical statement of work, to parse that work into concrete
								requirements, and to execute on those requirements while coordinating with third party vendors.
								Mary took technical direction well where needed, worked doggedly to fill in knowledge gaps,
								and executed on tasks exactly as expected.  Mary conducts all communication with customers
								and co-workers to utmost professional standards, and her professional maturity is an asset in
								an office setting for mentoring new employees." </p>

						<div class="recommend">
							<p>"I had the pleasure of working with Mary on a project to convert requirements into user stories for development.
							Her attention to detail is one of her strongest assets. Her persistence to ensure the correct information
							is collected and returned to clients points to her project management /business analyst skills.
							Mary’s eagerness helps a team achieve consensus on expectations of assigned tasks. Mary is not afraid to
							ask questions until she has a complete grasp of her responsibilities. I appreciate her contributions and
							efforts when working together."</p>

						<div class="recommend">
							<p>"Mary is an amazing person and an incredible resource. No-one
							digs into a problem like Mary, and her attention to detail is
							second-to-none. At Toolwire Mary inherited a system in desperate
							need of a "new sheriff". Where there was chaos and disparity Mary
							brought order and conformity."</p>

							Brett Gentry<br>
							Entrepreneur In Residence

						<div class="recommend">
							<p>"It’s my great pleasure to recommend Mary. I’ve worked directly
							with her for 5 years now. She is one of my primary go-to people at
							Toolwire and the true one-stop resource for everything about our
							OnDemand hosting platform. I can always rely on Mary to put her
							heart and soul into everything she does. She consistently
							demonstrates leadership initiative, leaving a path of organization
							and documentation where there previously was only chaos. She does
							a wonderful job of cross training the software and technical
							operations teams after every major project she manages or builds.
							Dogged, driven, fun, engaged, curious and thoughtful, are just
							some of the wonderful adjectives that describe her. If I go to
							another company I am bringing Mary with me if I can. So don't hire
							her JUST yet... "</p>

							oriented and is able to deliver her tasks on time. Highly
