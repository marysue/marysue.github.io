	<h1>Hi there, I'm Mary Lark!</h1>
	
	<p>Thank you for visiting my GitHub site!  I created this site to give you a bit of insight into my current professional
		qualifications, as well as where my ongoing education is taking me.  In the pages that follow, I hope to give you a
		pretty good understanding of who I am and what my abilities are.</p>
	<p><b>Where I came from: </b> Starting my career as a systems administrator I later discovered I had a passion for software engineering.  The blend of
		systems administration and software engineering put me in a sweet-spot of maximal efficiency as I can quickly pick
		up, understand, and troubleshoot complex workflows.  Although I do prefer software engineering, I have stayed up-to-date 
		on my systems administration knowledge.</p>
	
	<p><b>Who I am, in fun and work: </b>"My personality is witty and outgoing.  I love catching my teammates off-guard with humor.  There's nothing better than having 
		fun when you're in a high-stress analytic mode pushing towards a delivery.</p>
		
	<p>Don't get me wrong!  I'm extremely driven: Keeping on schedule and delivering high-quality work is my primary focus.  
		But you can take yourself too seriously sometimes, and that's when things around you can fall apart.  Also, I've found 
		if you keep attitudes light and fun, creativity flows much more freely and your work product ultimately reflects this.</p>
	
		<p><b>Presentations and teaching bonus!</b>  In additional to my technical experience, I really enjoy mentoring and teaching.  I have designed and
		delivered training classes to both technical and non-technical personnel.  I'm told my approach to teaching breaks 
		down complex information into digestable chunks that non-technical personnel can easily understand.
