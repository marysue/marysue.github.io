                        <h3>1980 - 2000 : Before websites were a thing ... application development was the thing</h3>
						<p class="profile">Having a broad background in software engineering, starting as a Unix Systems Administrator, moving
						into Software Development allowed me to quickly assimilate into complex environments quickly.</p>
						<p class="profile">After graduating from San Francisco State University, I spent 4 years programming
						in c and C++ in the gnu-unix and Visual Studio environments in financial systems and medical
						device enterprise development organizations.</p>
						<p class="profile">Taking a 12 year sabatical to raise my family (because of course, raising a family is like a vacation - right?),
						I returned to my technical career.  My timing couldn't have been more perfect, with the advent of javascript, html, css, Java, front-end and back-end engineering.  Boy was in for a surprise when I returned to work!</p>
						
                        <h3>2007 - 2011 : What is this fullstack thing?</h3>
                        <p class="profile">Tiptoeing into my surprise, I began working customer support and technical assistance at an Internet Service Provider
						installing security certificates and websites in Microsoft IIS/Apache-Tomcat environments. At this job I was exposed to HTML and CSS, but still no clue about the rest.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2011 - 2020 : I seem to be in fullstack development, I think?</h3>
                        <p class="profile">Then I moved on working as an IT Engineer for an educational services provider, providing customized citrix virtual
						environments, installing gateways, routers, domains, and virtualized desktops in both the Linux and Microsoft
						O/S's.  Shell scripting with Perl, VisualBasic, PowerShell, etc. were my main tools.</p>
						<p class="profile">The final year I moved into full-time development on an Agile development team working
						with Object Oriented programming.  I developed software within a pre-designed framework,
						expanding and maintaining code in Java in what they called their Middleware stack.  Using Javascript, PowerShell, Linux Shell Scripting and SQL -- all of which I knew from years earlier, and Java coding I slid into as it was much like C++ where I had prior experience.  Still, this notion of full stack was a bit nebulous to me.</p>
						<p class="profile">Not all good things last.  That company downsized dramatically and I needed to move on.  Finally, after spending a few years as an independent web designer, I decided to refresh my technical
							skills by returning to school.  I wanted a bootcamp that offered more than 3 mos instruction so I felt solid with my new skills
							before returning to work.  I found just that in appAcademy's 6-month immersive bootcamp.  Finally I understood just how much I had missed with my exit to raise my family.  It was considerable!
						</p>

                        <h3>2020:  Covid was good for something: Remote Learning!  I finally get this fullstack thing!</h3>
						<p class="profile">After graduating from appAcademy's bootcamp, my tech stack now includes: JavaScript,
							JSON, HTML, CSS, RegExp, Python, Pug Templates, React, Redux, Express.js, NodeJS, postgreSQL, MS SQL, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and Docker.  See my Skills portion of this site for all of my skills now.
						</p>

                        <h3>2021:  How the heck do I advertise myself?  All that experience, but now what?</h3>
                        <p class="profile">Using what I learned at appAcademy, I took a remote job as a mobile developer for a boutique event planning company where I worked with three talented developers using React and ReactNative.  Alas, cutbacks dictated the engineering group would be much cheaper offshore
                             engineers, so my job search continued.</p>
						<p class="profile">Entering the government workspace, I obtained my Secret government clearance working with Javascript, Docker, Docker Compose, and finally when I obtained my Secret clearance I moved on to Angular with a C# backend on embedded systems.</p>
                        <p class="profile">Even government contracts are not immune to cutbacks, and I found myself at another division, working with Swelt and Jasmine/vitest writing frontend components for the Saphire project.  I also upgraded my Secret Clearance to TS/SCI which was granted 1/25.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mid level full stack engineer available for hire</h3>
                        <p class="profile">Yes, you read that right.  Mid level.  I've had exactly 4 years, including school, learning  full stack engineering, and 3 years on the job.  I just moved out of an entry level position in frontend engineering.  So yes, low-midlevel frontend engineer or backend engineer...  Now that we know what to call me, I am currently available for full time work in the Denver metro area.  Hit me up if you're looking for someone with
							a nice broad background, current tech skills, leadership and mentorship skills, AND who brings fun, smiles, and a high level of productivity and commitment to the workplace!
